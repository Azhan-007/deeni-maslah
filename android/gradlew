#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh does
#       not find it, but you have some other '/bin/sh' around, it may work, but may
#       cause problems originating from bash. Disable this feature by setting the
#       environment variable CLASSPATH or by using the -classpath or -cp option to
#       set the classpath explicitly.
#
#   (2) Put the GRADLE_HOME environment variable in your environment. If you
#       do not know how to set environment variables, please refer to the
#       documentation for your shell.
#
#   (3) Add GRADLE_HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable in order to
#       have the `gradle` command available in your PATH.
#
#   Note: GRADLE_USER_HOME environment variable should point to a folder in order to
#   maintain compatibility with gw/gradlew scripts (Windows).
